# NSI-Free
Little fight game. It has features like some that are available in Mortal Kombat or Street Fighter.
Classes are built on top of PyGame features nor classes.

## What is wrong with this?
Mainly, the design. Like the painting system with frames switching. Instead of using the unmanaged code features, we done all in Py, which obviously makes all a... lot more slower. On the other hand, a major problem is Py class model, with shared, public and private attributes that, for example when you select the same persona, share some attributes like the life points :/

## What is good?
A good project with many little features that were kind of tricky to implement. Like the scrollbars, buttons, the menus and such. We learned a lot about this. Moreover, the painting methods, how an engine works (in part) due to the fact that we implemented it ourselves instead of using the PyGame builtin one. There is the logic too.

## After?
Now it is no longer maintained. That was an end-of-year project, that at all doesn't interest the old members and me too.

## License?
Yes, of course Open Source! Use it freely, base other things on it if you want to. It is GPL V3, but all the code, no more. Some images used are from other members, so better to don't use them as long as I don't know if they had agreement or it just comes from somewhere in the web. For example the backgrounds and some personas.
